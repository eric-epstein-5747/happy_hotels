# happy_hotels
In this project, I examine a large number of hotel reviews, identify the topics discussed, assign each hotel a score on each topic, and surface, for each topic, an important sentence about that topic.

# First Iteration
In the first iteration, I implement the topic modeling. Later iterations will approach scoring and content surfacing. 

# Inspiration
I apply the insights on Gensim found here:
